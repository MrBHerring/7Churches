                    On the prophetic calendar, a day = a year.

                <p>
                    Numbers 14:34.  After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know My breach of promise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ezekiel 4:4-6
4 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. 5 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 6 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The concept of the 7-year tribulation is derived from the prophecy of Daniel’s “seventy weeks”.  Whereas, each week is equal to seven days, and seven days is prophetically equivalent to seven years.  Therefore, the seventy weeks is equivalent to 490 years (which is 70 weeks * 7 days = 490 days ≈ prophetic 490 years).

                </p>

                <p>
                    Daniel 9:24.  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people ‘AM and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

                    Daniel’s prophetic message revealed a schedule was determined to restore the people of Judah and rebuild the city of Jerusalem.  The restoration/renovation schedule was determined to be a period of 70 weeks (490 years).  The edict to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (which was recorded in Ezra 7) was given in the year 457 B.C., which initiated the 70-week schedule.  The 70-week schedule is divided into 69 weeks (483 years) to rebuild the city of Jerusalem and one remaining week (7 years) to restore the people of Judah.  The 69-week period to renovate Jerusalem is a sum of a 7-week period (49 years) and a 62-week period (434 years).  The Messiah the Prince was scheduled to reveal Himself at the end of the 62-week period.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Daniel 9:25.  Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks {62 weeks}: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.

            •	Seven weeks – 
                7 weeks = 7 * 7 days = 49 days ≈ 49 prophetic years

            •	Threescore [3 * a score (≈ 20) = 60] and two weeks = 62 weeks – 
                62 weeks = 62 * 7 days = 434 days ≈ 434 prophetic years

            •	Seven weeks + Threescore and two weeks [62 weeks] = 
                69 weeks = 7 weeks + 62 weeks = 49 days + 434 days ≈ 483 prophetic years

                <p>
                    The last week of the 70-week schedule is dedicated to the restoration of the people unto the Messiah the Prince, who was later revealed to be Jesus the son of Joseph and Mary from Nazareth.  Jesus was revealed to be the Messiah (Christ) during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius Caesar.  Tiberius Caesar began his reign in the year 12 A.D.  So in the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar (27 A.D.), Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost coming in the form a dove after He was baptized by John the Baptist (Mt 3:16; Mk 1:10; Lu 3:22; John 1:32), which was the culmination of the 69 weeks (483 years).

                    Luke 3:1.  Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,

                <p>
                    In the midst of the remaining week (7 years), the Messiah (Christ) was cut off (crucified on the cross).  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Daniel 9:26.  And after threescore and two weeks {62 weeks} shall Messiah {the Christ} be cut off, but not for Himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jesus the Messiah was crucified in the midst of the last week (7 years) of the 70-week schedule.  Thus, the 7-year period of restoring the people unto the Messiah was cut off in 3 1\2 years when they crucified the Messiah on the cross.  The crucifixion was a sacrificial offering to make reconciliation for the iniquities of the people, which was the way God the Father restored the people unto the Messiah.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In preparation for the sacrificial offering, the Messiah made an end of sins by suffering the chastisement of our peace, which ended the animosity the LORD had for mankind.  The wounds the Messiah received from the scourging on the whip was the blood offering the LORD required for our transgressions and bruises the Messiah received from the hands of His captors was the sacrifice the LORD required for our iniquities.
Isaiah 53:5.  But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.

The sacrificial offering on the cross provided reconciliation for our iniquities and satisfied one of the six requirements for restoring the people unto the Messiah.
Hebrews 9:28.  So Christ {the Messiah} was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

Hebrews 9:24-25
24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: 25 Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;

                    Since, the Messiah (Jesus) was cut off in 3½ years (midst of the week), there is still 3½ years remaining to finish confirming the covenant with His people in regards to Daniel’s last week (7 years).  For 3½ years the Messiah confirmed the renewed (new) covenant (testament) with the children of Israel and His confirmation ended with His crucifixion (cutting off).  Also note that when the Book of Daniel is compared to the Book of Revelation, there are various references to periods of 1260 days (a thousand two hundred and threescore days) or 42 months (forty and two months) or a time, times, and half a time (a time and times and the dividing of time or a time, times, and an half) which are all equivalent to 3½ prophetic years.

                    Revelation 11:2-3
2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months {3 ½ years}. 3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days {3 ½ years}, clothed in sackcloth.

                    •	The Gregorian calendar we use is a solar calendar that is based upon the revolution of the earth around the sun.  The Gregorian calendar account of a solar year is 365 days because it takes approximately 365 ¼ days for the earth to revolve around the sun.
•	The Hebraic calendar is a lunar calendar based upon the revolution of the moon around the earth and the phases of the moon from one new moon to the next.  The Hebraic calendar account of a year is 354 days because the moon cycles through its phases in approximately 354 1/3 days.  Each month in the Hebraic calendar is either 29 days long or 30 days long to account for a year of 354 days.
•	The prophetic calendar of the word of God is 360 days long with each month being 30 days long.  Thus, 1260 days (a thousand two hundred and threescore days) and 42 months (forty and two months) are equivalent to 3 ½ years on the prophetic calendar. 
o	Forty and two months = 42 (months) ÷ 12 (months) = 3 ½ years
o	Thousand two hundred and threescore days = 1260 (days) ÷ 30 (days) = 42 (months) = 3 ½ years

                    •	Since the Hebraic calendar is based upon the lunar cycles of the moon, to account for the lost of time in the lunar calendar over the passing of years, periodically a month is added to the end of a year.  The last month on the Hebraic calendar is the month of Adar.  In the leap year of the Hebraic calendar (the year a month is added to the calendar), the last two months of the year are called Adar I and Adar II.  So, the leap year will have 13months instead of the normal 12 months in a year.  The 1290 days (thousand two hundred and ninety days) on the prophetic calendar could very well be accounting for a leap year during the 3 ½ year fulfillment of Daniel’s 70 weeks.

                    •	The 1335 days (thousand three hundred and five and thirty days) could be alluding to Hanukah (Chanukah).  If you take into account the 70-week schedule culminates with the Last Great Day, in the month of Tishrei.  And Tishrei begins with the Feast of Trumpets, followed by the Day of Atonement, Feast of Tabernacles, and ends with the Last Great Day.  Hanukah is celebrated approximately 75 days from the Last Great Day.  Hanukah is a feast with characteristics alluding to the great wedding feast of the Bridegroom (Christ) and the Bride (the Church).  Thus, the 1260 days (3 ½ years) ends Daniel’s 70 weeks and ushers in the millennial reign of the Messiah that will be kicked off with a party 75 days later, which is the great wedding feast of the Bride and Bridegroom.
