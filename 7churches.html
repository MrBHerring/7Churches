        <h1>THE SEVEN CHURCHES </h1>
        <div class="introduction__container">
            <div class="introduction__text">
                <p>Chapters 2 & 3 are about the Church, which is symbolically represented as seven candlesticks in chapter 1.  
                    The seven candlesticks are a symbol of seven churches in seven cities of the ancient province of Asia Minor.  
                </p>

                <p>Revelation 1:11-12, 20</p>

                <p>
                "11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, 
                write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; 
                unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira,
                and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 
                12 And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. 
                And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 
                20 The mystery of … the seven golden candlesticks. 
                The … seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.""

                </p>

                <p>
                    The Church represents both the body of Christ and children of Mother Jerusalem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ephesians 5:23-25, 27, 29, 32
                </p>

                <p>

                    
                    "23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and He is the Savior of the body. 
                    24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. 
                    25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it; 
                    27 That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; 
                    but that it should be holy and without blemish. 29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; 
                    but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church: 
                    32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.""
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lord dictated seven letters (epistles) containing individual reproofs and encouragements to each church.  
                    Each church simultaneously represents seven distinct congregations in the collective body of Christ who are the saints in the Book of Revelation.  Each church also represents seven ages of growth and development in the collective body of Christ.
                    
                    The composition of the body of the epistles to the seven churches consists of:
                    1.	An Inscription – addressing the angel of the church, followed with an epigraph exposing the divine character and attributes of the Messiah;
                    2.	An Evaluation – acknowledging the works of the congregation and revealing their character;
                    3.	A Consultation – instructing the congregation with admonitions and exhortations on how to become victors in their trials; and
                    4.	An Incentive – establishing the hope of the calling for the collective assembly of saints.
                    
                    Even though the epistles were addressing churches existing during the lifetime of John the Apostle,
                    every message is applicable for every generation of saints who keep the commandments of God and adhere to the faith in Jesus Christ.
                    Thus, at the conclusion of each epistle, the Lord reiterates the message of,
                        “He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches”,
                        which enforces the relevance of the messages Christ gave to the saints who will be experiencing the trials and tribulations of the last days.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The saints of the last days before the coming of Jesus Christ will be able to identify with one of the seven churches because the characteristics of the churches are still prevalent in the current age of the body of Christ.  Therefore, the last day saints can rely on the epistles as applicable counsel from the Lord during the trials and tribulations of the last days.  And the theme of the epistles will echo in their hearts, which is:
He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.

                </p>

                    Ephesus the Church of the Laborers – “Desirable; Permitted” – Age of the Apostles [70 AD – 170 AD] - Rev 2:1-7
1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things says HE THAT HOLDS THE SEVEN STARS IN HIS RIGHT HAND, WHO WALKS IN THE MIDST OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN CANDLESTICKS; 2 I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you can’t bear them which are evil: and you have tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars: 3 And has borne, and had patience, and for My name's sake have labored, and have not fainted. 4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love. 5 Remember therefore from where you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his place, except you repent. 6 But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 7 He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; TO HIM THAT OVERCOMES WILL I GIVE TO EAT OF THE TREE OF LIFE, WHICH IS IN THE MIDST OF THE PARADISE OF GOD.

8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things says THE FIRST AND THE LAST, WHICH WAS DEAD, AND IS ALIVE; 9 I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. 10 Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life. 11 He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; HE THAT OVERCOMES SHALL NOT BE HURT OF THE SECOND DEATH.

                    Pergamos the Church of the Fallen – “Height; Elevation” – Age of the Apostasy [312 AD – 606 AD] - Rev 2:12-17
12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things says HE WHICH HAS THE SHARP SWORD WITH TWO EDGES; 13 I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast My name, and has not denied My faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells. 14 But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. 15 So have you also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. 16 Repent; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth. 17 He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches; TO HIM THAT OVERCOMES WILL I GIVE TO EAT OF THE HIDDEN MANNA, AND WILL GIVE HIM A WHITE STONE, AND IN THE STONE A NEW NAME WRITTEN, WHICH NO MAN KNOWS SAVING HE THAT RECEIVES IT.

                    18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things says THE SON OF GOD, WHO HAS HIS EYES LIKE UNTO A FLAME OF FIRE, AND HIS FEET ARE LIKE FINE BRASS; 19 I know your works, and charity, and service, and faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first. 20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. 21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. 22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. 23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am He, which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. 24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. 25 But that which you have already hold fast till I come. 26 AND HE THAT OVERCOMES, AND KEEPS MY WORKS UNTO THE END, TO HIM WILL I GIVE POWER OVER THE NATIONS: 27 AND HE SHALL RULE THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON; AS THE VESSELS OF A POTTER SHALL THEY BE BROKEN TO SHIVERS: EVEN AS I RECEIVED OF MY FATHER. 28 AND I WILL GIVE HIM THE MORNING STAR. 29 He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.

                    1 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things says HE THAT HAS THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD, AND THE SEVEN STARS; I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, and are dead. 2 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found your works perfect before God. 3 Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore you shall not watch, I will come on you as a thief, and you shall not know what hour I will come upon you. 4 You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. 5 HE THAT OVERCOMES, THE SAME SHALL BE CLOTHED IN WHITE RAIMENT; AND I WILL NOT BLOT OUT HIS NAME OUT OF THE BOOK OF LIFE, BUT I WILL CONFESS HIS NAME BEFORE MY FATHER, AND BEFORE HIS ANGELS. 6 He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.

14 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things says THE AMEN, THE FAITHFUL AND TRUE WITNESS, THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD; 15 I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot: I wish you were cold or hot. 16 So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spit you out of My mouth. 17 Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: 18 I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see. 19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. 20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me. 21 TO HIM THAT OVERCOMES WILL I GRANT TO SIT WITH ME IN MY THRONE, EVEN AS I ALSO OVERCAME, AND AM SET DOWN WITH MY FATHER IN HIS THRONE. 22 He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.

                    The Seat of Satan — 

The dwelling of Satan (v. 2:13) executing the Body of the Fallen (Pergamos) with the: 

Persecution from the devil through the Synagogue of Satan (v. 2:9-10) 

Scandal (stumbling block) caused by accepting the teachings of the doctrine of Balaam (v. 2:14) 

Subjugation through the doctrine of the Nicolaitans (v. 2:15) 

Synagogue of Satan — 

The Synagogue of Satan (v. 2:9) blaspheming and persecuting the Body of the Afflicted (Smyrna) 

The lies of the Synagogue of Satan (v. 3:9) perverting paths of the Body of the Poor (Philadelphia) 

Jezebel the Prophetess (v. 2:20-24) — 

Corrupting the Body of Harlots (Thyatira) with the: 

Stumbling block of desolation (Balac) in the knowledge of the depths of Satan (v. 2:14, 24) 

Deeds of adultery to eat things sacrificed to idols and commit fornication (v. 2:14, 22, 24)

                <p>
                    False Apostles — false teachers (Rev 2:2) operating in the spirit of the Antichrist (e.g., Cerinthus the Gnostic heretic who opposed John the Evangelist) 

Nicolaitans —  

Nicolaitan – means to conquer (overcome) the laity (people) and comes from the Greek root words: 

nikao - meaning to conquer or overcome 

laos - meaning people which is where the word laity comes from 

A good translation of Nicolaitan would be “those who prevail over the people” 

Deeds of the Nicolaitans (v. 2:6) - lead lives of unrestrained self indulgence by: 

Practicing occult paganism (committing fornication) 

Assimilating idol worship into Christianity (eating the things sacrificed unto idols)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0oqeUyxrf0 

Doctrine of the Nicolaitans (v. 2:15) taught: 

The necessity of instituting the priestly order (clergy) that consisted of a hierarchy of the ruling class to usurp the church overseers (bishops, presbyters, ministers, etc.) who were elected by members of the congregation because they were men led by the Holy Ghost 

The Law (Torah) of Moses was supplanted by the atoning grace of Christ’s sacrificial offering and so man is free to commit acts of sexual immorality (deeds of the flesh and sin)

Insurrection against the theocracies of God and pagan gods 

Incites states and religions to persecute saints in the names of God and/or pagan gods of the state 

Subjugate the Fallen (Pergamos) by:

                <p>
                    From the beginning, Satan has always been an enemy to the Body of Christ.  He’s the Dragon (Devil, that old Serpent) that opposes the Word and saints in the end-times.  
                    But in the last days, the natural enemies to the Body of Christ are the Devil’s Synagogue of Satan, Jezebel the Prophetess, false prophets, and Nicolaitans.
                    The first attack on the Body of Christ, by the enemy, was from the Synagogue of Satan that tried to stop the Christian movement with persecution of the saints in Jerusalem.
